# YUVViewer4Linux  
这是一个Linux下的YUV image 看图工具   
It is a Yuv image viwer for Linux   

在Windows中有YUV Viewer,但在Linux中没有。这很不方便，所以我自己基于QT做了类似YUV viewer的看图工具...  
There is YUV Viewer in Windows, but not in Linux. This is very inconvenient, so I made a picture viewing tool similar to YUV viewer based on QT.
